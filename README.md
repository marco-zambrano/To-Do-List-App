## ‚ÄºÔ∏è How to Run the Project Correctly
This project uses **JavaScript modules (`type="module"`)** and fetches **local files**, which can cause issues if run directly using `file://`.  
To avoid CORS errors and browser restrictions, **you must run it using a local server**.

### ‚úÖ Option 1: Use Live Server (Recommended)
If you use **VS Code**, follow these steps:
1. Install the **Live Server** extension if you haven't already.
2. Open the project in VS Code.
3. Right-click on `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
4. The project will open at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/` without issues.

### ‚úÖ Option 2: Start a Server with Python
If you don‚Äôt use Live Server, you can start a simple server using Python:
1. Open the terminal in the project folder.
2. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   python -m http.server 5500
